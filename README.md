# KCJ Physics

A program that incorporates three different simulations in one application to demonstrate different physics concepts. The program will include a gravity simulator, a ricochet simulator, and a collision simulator. 

Uses `JavaFX 20.0.2`, and includes the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) (no need to install Gradle locally).

## Features

- Gravity simulator: satellite orbiting a planet
- Ricochet simulator: projectile launched at a wall with an angle
- Collision simulator: collision of two sliding blocks

## NetBeans

This project template was tested with `NetBeans 17` and `JDK 18`.
